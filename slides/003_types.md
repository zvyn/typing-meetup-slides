Types in Python
===============

Python is dynamically typed:

 * the `type` of an `object` is _always well defined_
 * a _variable_ can be assigned to _any_ `object`
 * a variable can be _reassigned_ to any object _at runtime_

The opposite would be a statically typed language where a variable can only
point at an object of a declared type.

This is by design!

But it can lead to runtime bugs when you assumptions about what type a
variable has are wrong.
