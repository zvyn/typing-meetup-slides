# Typing Meetup

Adding type annotations to existing code


# Development Setup

After cloning the repo and `cd`ing into it:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv env
env/bin/pip install -U pip
env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt -r dev-requirements.txt
```

# Usage

I used nvim with `coc-pyright` set up for the presentation.

Your milage may vary with that:

```
nvim -S Session.vim
```
